"a woman in a dress shirt and tie ... is all the party can discern through the smoke. 
Called Sarah Henry, they are a Druid from the fort known as Alfby.
They are known for their expertise in the field of Investigation, they wish they were more knowledegable about Camouflage and are truly terrible at both Lasso and Fire Breathing. Interestingly Sarah Henry wears an excessive amount of gaudy jewelry."
